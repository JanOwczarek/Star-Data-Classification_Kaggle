# Star Data Classification
 This document classifies the start dataset available on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17). I use both supervised approach to calssify data and unsupervised approaches to explore hidden structures within data (K-Nearest Neighbours, K-Means and DBSCAN).
