# Star Data Classification
 This document classifies the start dataset available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17). I use supervised approaches to classify data and unsupervised techniques to explore hidden structures within data (K-Nearest Neighbours, K-Means and DBSCAN). Additionally, I use Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and compare models that used PCA and ones that did not. The python notebook should be well-annotated explaining all reasoning and additional resources used. 

Note: DBSCAN did not have a PCA version comparison and I aim to fill in this gap when I have time!
